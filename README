NEVER manually modify anything in the package dirs in this repo.
Do it in their own repos and run the syncpkg.sh

# create your own "AUR instance"

aur helper `paru` added supports for a custom repo

https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru/issues/719

for this to work, I need to have a repository that has all of my PKGBUILDs. The
problem is: they are already VCS controlled

what the syncpkgs.sh script does is to convert this

my_pkgs/
    |- pkg1/
    |   |- PKGBUILD
    |   |- .git
    |- pkg2/
    |   |- PKGBUILD
    |   |- .git
    |- pkg3/
        |- PKGBUILD
        |- .git

to this:

webhost/
    |- pkg1/
    |   |- PKGBUILD
    |- pkg2/
    |   |- PKGBUILD
    |- pkg3/
    |   |- PKGBUILD
    |-.git
